This project is about developing a learning analytics dashboard based on clicker data. 

**Objectives**

1. Understand the structure of the clicker data
2. Create multiple different visualizations
3. Design and implement an instructor and student dashboard
4. Critically evaluate your own dashboard design

I am given aggregated clicker records for a CS course taught at Cornell. There are two datasets: the experience dataset and the quiz dataset.


**Data**

The **experience dataset** contains one record per student who completed the CS course between 2016-2018. There are two sources to this dataset: Faculty Center and a Skills Survey (administered via the Blackboard LMS) where students self reported their skill level for various skills the first week of class. This data has been de-identified.  Name, netid, emplid, major have all been removed and replaced with a unique numeric identifier. Note that not all students completed the skills survey, they will have null values for the survey result fields.

|Attribute Name|Data Type|Definition|
|--------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
|student_key|numeric Unique key|Assigned as part of de-identification process.  Uniquely identifies student records for this data set only.|
|year|numeric|Four digit year student was enrolled in BI Class.|
|prog|character Values (GRAD, UGRAD)|Indicates whether the student was a graduate or undergraduate student when they were enrolled in BI course.|
|database_score|numeric (0-5)|Self reported experience level with database technology prior to taking course. 0= no experience, 5= expertise|
|sql_score|	numeric (0-5)|Self reported experience level with SQL prior to taking course. 0= no experience, 5=expertise|
|programing_score|numeric (0-5)|Self reported experience level with Any Programing language prior to taking course. 0=no experience, 5=expertise|
|stored_proc_score|	numeric (0-5)|Self reported experience level with stored procedure languages prior to taking course. 0=no experience, 5=expertise|
|etl_score|	numeric (0-5)|Self reported experience level with Extract Transform Load (ETL) development prior to taking course. 0=no experience, 5=expertise|
|data_vis_score|numeric (0-5)|Self reported experience level using data visualization tools prior to taking course. 0=no experience, 5=expertise|
|requirement_gather_score|numeric (0-5)|Self reported experience level gathering customer requirements prior to taking course. 0=no experience, 5=expertise|
|skill_survey_score|numeric|Sum of the self reported skill level scores.|

The **quiz dataset** contains one record per student per class session held where iClickers were used. Sources used in the creation of this data set include: iClicker session xml files, Blackboard gradebook (for quiz scores), and the Blackboard class schedule (used to map iClicker session to related quiz scores). Note that in some cases there are multiple iClicker sessions / lectures associated with a single quiz. This dataset may be joined to the experience dataset by the student_key field. 

|Attribute Name|Data Type|Definition|
|--------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
|Acad_date_key|numeric|Date key in the form of YYYYMMDD indicating the date the class session was held.|
|student_key|numeric|Unique identifier for students who took BI class 2016-2018.  This key is the primary key for the experience_data file.|
|year|numeric|Four digit year class session was held.|
|session_number|numeric|Identifies the session number for a particular semester.  Session number is assigned by iClicker.|
|quiz_number|numeric|There are 10 quizzes throughout the BI course.  This attribute indicates which quiz is associated with the iClicker session(s).|
|attended|numeric (0,1)|Binary indicating whether the student attended that particular class session / lecture. 0=no, 1=yes.|
|total_possible_clicker|numeric|The total number of iClicker questions asked that session.|
|total_completed_clicker|numeric|The number of iClicker questions answered by student that session.|
|completed_q_clicker|numeric|The number of completed Quiz iClicker questions|
|correct_q_clicker|numeric|How many correct Quiz answers by student that session.|
|completed_t_clicker|number|How many Temperature questions answered by student that session. Temperature questions are 0-5, 0= bad, 5=great. There is no correct answer to Temperature questions, they are used to guage how students are feeling about a particular subject, assignment, etc.|
|avg_t_clicker|number|The average temperature answer by student for that session.  An average of 1 or 2 would be generally negative, while 4 or 5 would be generally positive responses.|
|quiz_score|numeric|Quiz score out of 20 points possible.|

# Part 1: Planning / Sketching


**Question 1:** You will make a student dashboard and a teacher dashboard. Carefully consider the implications of this for design and content. To plan, answer the following prompts once for the student dashboard and then for the teacher dashboard. The more concrete you are here the easier it will be later. Focus on the concrete ideas that you will implement in the next steps. You can iterate on this step and modify your responses as your ideas for the dashboard become clearer. You should explore the dataset in R for 5-10 minutes to get a good sense of what the dataset has to offer.

*Planning for the student dashboard*

* For whom? Who will use it and what is their background?
    + [The student dashboard is designed for students enrolled in the CS course on Business Intelligence using iClickers.]
    + [Students encounter numerous dashboards across various platforms daily, increasing the likelihood of information overload.]
    
* Why? What is the goal? What questions to answer?
    + [The main goal is to provide students with an overview of their performance in quizzes throughout the course, specifically focusing on accuracy per quiz.]
    + [Comparing their performance with that of their peers.Identifying skills that require further development.Engaging in deep reflection on their overall performance.]

* What? What data to show and what is its structure?
    + [To create the student dashboard, we require both individual student data and their performance relative to others. One effective approach could be to merge the experience and quiz datasets using the "STUDENT_ID" column to visualize data comprehensively.]
        
* How? How will visualizations support the goal?
    + [Visualizations will enable students to conveniently track their data trends over time. They can also use them to compare their performance with that of their peers effortlessly.]
    
*Planning for the teacher dashboard*

* For whom? Who will use it and what is their background?
    + [The teacher dashboard is designed for the instructor of the CS course on Business Intelligence. They will use it to gain insights into the overall class performance and engagement.]
    
* Why? What is the goal? What questions to answer?
    + [The main goal is to provide the instructor with an overview of the class characteristics, engagement, and performance, including the confidence of students in each skill.]

* What? What data to show and what is its structure?
    + [We will be showing the confidence of students in each skill, based on the skill_survey_score column in the experience dataset.]
    + [The structure of the data can stay relatively the same, but omit the N/A answers.]
        
* How? How will visualizations support the goal?
    + [Using a bar graph will help visualize how much of a gap of confidence there is in the different skills.]
    + [Visualizations will effectively summarize the key insights from the data for the instructor, providing a quick overview of areas where the material may not be effective, allowing them to better prepare for future course]



Each dashboard should contain at least 4 data visualizations. You may include any additional summary statistics (e.g. key percentages or tables).

```

# Part 2: Dashboard Wire-frame Implementation

This is where I generate the dashboard layout.

Your team can split up the tasks. Some work on creating the UI (this part), while others work on pre-processing the data and creating the statistics and visualizations that will populate the UI (next part).

Creating the layout for the dashboard tabs.
